# Screening coefficients on a reduced k/q mesh

To make the calculation of the screening coefficient sufficiently fast, we run it for a 
2x2x2 kmesh. For this reason we have to re-generate the Wannier functions on this grid;
This is done in "wannier222". The screening coefficients are then calculated in the 
"screening" folder.
