\head{Reminder of conditions and definitions} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Interatomic Force Constants: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ground state is a structural local minimum: forces are vanishing; 
		\item We consider only small displacements around minimum:
			$$ \mathrm{\mathbf{R}_I} = \mathrm{\mathbf{R}^0_I} + \mathrm{\mathbf{u}_I} $$ 
	        \item  Forces have a linear dependence on small displacements: 
			$$ \mathrm{\mathbf{F}_I}(\{\mathrm{\mathbf{u}_I}\}) = -\sum_J{
				\frac{\partial^2{\mathrm{E}}}{\partial{\mathrm{\mathbf{u}_I}}\partial{\mathrm{\mathbf{u}_J}}}\cdot \mathrm{\mathbf{u}_J}
			} $$
		\item The set of force constants  $\mathrm{K}_{I,\alpha,J,\beta}$ thus  describes the dynamics of the harmonic system:  
			$$ \mathrm{K}_{I,\alpha,J,\beta}  = \frac{\partial^2{\mathrm{E}}}{\partial{\mathrm{u}_{I,\alpha}}\partial{\mathrm{u}_{J,\beta}}}$$
		\item Because of the periodicity we can rewrite $\mathrm{K}$ in a translationally invariant form:  
			$$ \mathrm{K}_{I_{\kappa},\alpha,J_{\sigma},\beta} = \mathrm{K}_{\kappa,\alpha,\sigma,\beta}(\mathrm{\mathbf{R}}_\kappa-\mathrm{\mathbf{R}}_\sigma)$$ 

	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\head{Reminder of conditions and definitions}
\begin {itemize}
\item Monochromatic displaclemt patterns . 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For infinite periodic systems it is necessary to decompose the dynamics into separate finite monochromatic modes: 
			$$ \tilde{\mathrm{\mathbf{u}}}(\mathbf{q}) i\cdot e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}$$ 	
		\item The generic monochromatic mode is described by the generalized amplitude:  
			$$\tilde{\mathrm{u}}_{\kappa,\alpha} = \sqrt{\mathrm{M}_{\kappa}}\mathrm{u}^0_{\kappa,\alpha} $$ 
			with $\kappa$ running on the atomic indexes of the lattice basis and $\alpha$ the cartesian indexes.
		\item  and a wavevector $\mathrm{\mathbf{q}}$ within the Brillouin zone  
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

\head{Reminder of conditions and definitions} 
\begin{itemize} 
		\item Dynamical matrices: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item At each $\mathbf{q}$  the equation of motion  are recast into a symmetric eigenvalue  problem for the generalized amplitude:   
	    $$ \sum_{\sigma,\beta}{D_{\kappa,\alpha;\sigma,\beta} \cdot \tilde{u}_{\sigma,\beta}} = \omega^2 \tilde{u}_{\kappa,\alpha} $$ 
    \item Where $\mathbf{D}$ is the mass symmetrized Fourier transform of the interatomic force constant matrix: 
	    $$ D_{\kappa,\alpha;\sigma,\beta}(\mathbf{q}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_{\kappa}M_{\sigma}}} \sum_{\mathbf{R}}
		{K_{\kappa,\alpha,\sigma,\beta}(\mathbf{R}) e^{i \mathbf{q}\cdot{\mathbf{R}}}}$$ 
    \item Alternatively, more useful for plane-wave formalism,  the  dynamical matrices can be computed directly as mixed second derivatives of the energy with respect to 
	    the monochromatic displacements.
