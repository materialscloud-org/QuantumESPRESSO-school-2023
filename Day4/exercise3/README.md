# Description

This example show how to use pw.x and kcw.x to compute the 
electronic structure of the ozone molecule (O<sub>3</sub>). The entire
calculation is split down into three steps:

* 1_init: Contains the inputs for the initial DFT calculation and for the interface with the KCW code
* 2_screening: Contains the input for the calculation of the KI screening coefficients
* 3_hamiltonian: Contains the inputs for the final KI calculation
