# Description

This example show how to compute the KI electronic structure of the ozone molecule (O<sub>3</sub>). 
You will first use the core fortran implementation `kcp.x` to run a simplified KI calculation
(more details inside "byhand"), and then you will use the `koopmans` package to run a full and 
automated KI calculation (more details inside "automated")
